# Green Trap

This repository initializes the **green_trap_analysis** workspace for fetching World Development Indicators data, performing basic preprocessing, and exploring clustering analyses.

The project files live in the `green_trap_analysis/` directory and include:
- Data folders for raw and processed artifacts.
- A lightweight `src/` package with configuration, data loading, and preprocessing utilities.
- A starter Jupyter notebook for exploration.

Refer to `green_trap_analysis/README.md` for setup and usage instructions.
